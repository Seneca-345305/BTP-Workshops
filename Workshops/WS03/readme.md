# Workshop #3: Multimedia Management Application

In this workshop, you will to create an application to manage movies and books. The information about different media items will be loaded in objects from files, and the object will be managed by collection types using STL collections and algorithms.


## Submission Policy

The workshop should contain ***only work done by you this term*** or provided by your professor.  Work done in another term (by you or somebody else), or work done by somebody else and not **clearly identified/cited** is considered plagiarism, in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

- If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

    > I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.

- If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which parts of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.



## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
/usr/local/gcc/10.2.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++17`: the code will be compiled using the C++17 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use `diff` available on `matrix`.




## Multimedia Management System

In this application you code classes to load from files information about books, movies, and TV shows, create objects with the loaded information and manage those objects using STL containers and algorithms. If something goes wrong during the execution, you will report it to clients using exceptions.

Put all the global variables, global functions/operator overloads, and types inside the `seneca` namespace and include the necessary guards in each header file.



### `settings` Module

The `settings` will contain functionality regarding configuration of the application. Design and code a structure named `Settings`; in the header, *declare* a global variable of this type named `g_settings` and define it in the implementation file.

For simplicity reasons, this type will contain only public data-members and no member-functions.

#### Public Members

- `m_maxSummaryWidth` an integer in 2 bytes that will store the maximum width of text then printing the summary of a media item. By default, the width is 80.
- `m_tableView` as a Boolean attribute; when `true`, print to screen the information about the media intems formated as a table. By default, this attribute is `false`.





### `mediaItem` module (supplied)


This module contains information about a generic multimedia item (a book, movie, or TV show).

**Do not modify this module!**  Study the code supplied and make sure you understand it.





### `book` Module

Design and code a class named `Book` derived from `MediaItem` that can store the following information (for each attribute, chose any type that you think is appropriate--you must be able to justify the decisions you have made):

- `m_author`: the author of the book
- **title** (inherited)
- `m_country`: the country of publication
- **the year of publication** (inherited)
- `m_price`: the price of the book
- **the summary** (inherited): a short description of the book


#### Private Members

- add any constructors that are necessary for your design

This class will not offer any public constructors.


#### Public Members

- `void display(std::ostream& out) const override`: override this function to print the information about a single book. Use the following implementation:

  ```cpp
	void display(std::ostream& out) const
	{
		if (g_settings.m_tableView)
		{
			out << "B | ";
			out << std::left << std::setfill('.');
			out << std::setw(50) << this->getTitle() << " | ";
			out << std::right << std::setfill(' ');
			out << std::setw(2) << this->m_country << " | ";
			out << std::setw(4) << this->getYear() << " | ";
			out << std::left;
			if (g_settings.m_maxSummaryWidth > -1)
			{
				if (static_cast<short>(this->getSummary().size()) <= g_settings.m_maxSummaryWidth)
					out << this->getSummary();
				else
					out << this->getSummary().substr(0, g_settings.m_maxSummaryWidth - 3) << "...";
			}
			else
				out << this->getSummary();
			out << std::endl;
		}
		else
		{
			size_t pos = 0;
			out << this->getTitle() << " [" << this->getYear() << "] [";
			out << m_author << "] [" << m_country << "] [" << m_price << "]\n";
			out << std::setw(this->getTitle().size() + 7) << std::setfill('-') << "" << '\n';
			while (pos < this->getSummary().size())
			{
				out << "    " << this->getSummary().substr(pos, g_settings.m_maxSummaryWidth) << '\n';
				pos += g_settings.m_maxSummaryWidth;
			}
			out << std::setw(this->getTitle().size() + 7) << std::setfill('-') << ""
				<< std::setfill(' ') << '\n';
		}
	}
  ```

- `Book* createItem(const std::string& strBook)`: a class function that receives as parameter the representation of the book as a string and builds a dynamically-allocated object of type `Book` using the information from the string and returns it to the client. The parameter contains a single line of text extracted from the file `books.csv`. The format of the line is as following:

  ```txt
  AUTHOR,TITLE,COUNTRY,PRICE,YEAR,SUMMARY
  ```

  This function should remove all spaces from the **beginning and end** of any token in the string.

  If the parameter is an empty string or a string starting with `#`, raise an exception with the message `Not a valid book.`. (lines in the file starting with `#` are considered comments and should be ignored).

  If all the data is correctly loaded, create a dynamic object of type `Book` using your private constructors and return its address to the client.

  When implementing this function, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::substr()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/substr)
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)
  - [std::string::erase()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/erase)

- **id**
- **title** (inherited)
- **the year of release** (inherited)

- `Movie* createItem(const std::string& strShow)`: a class function that receives as parameter the representation of the TV Show as a string and builds a dynamically-allocated object of type `TvShow` using the information from the string and returns it to the client. The parameter contains a single line of text extracted from the file `tvShows.csv`. The format of the line is as following:

  ```txt
  ID,TITLE,YEAR,SUMMARY
  ```

  This function should remove all spaces from the **beginning and end** of any token in the string.

  If the parameter is an empty string or a string starting with `#`, raise an exception with the message `Not a valid show.` (lines in the file starting with `#` are considered comments and should be ignored).

  If all the data is correctly loaded, create a dynamic object of type `TvShow` using your private constructors and return its address to the client.

  When implementing this function, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::substr()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/substr)
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)

  If the parameter is an empty string or a string starting with `#`, raise an exception with the message `Not a valid episode.` (lines in the file starting with `#` are considered comments and should be ignored).

  If an episode is missing the season info, it's considered to be in season 1.

- `double getEpisodeAverageLength() const`: get the average length in seconds of an episode.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This is a `TASK` that you must accomplish using STL Algorithms and no manual loops. The STL algorithms used for this task should not be used for another task. Your lambda expressions should not capture anything from the context by reference.

- `std::list<std::string> getLongEpisodes() const`: create a list with episode names that are at leat 1 hour long.

**Add any other private member that is required by your design!**





### `spellChecker` Module (functor)


Add a `SpellChecker` class to your project. This class holds two parallel arrays of strings, both of size 6 (statically allocated):

- `m_badWords`: an array with 6 misspelled words
- `m_goodWords`: an array with the correct spelling of those 6 words
- any other member required by your design to accomplish the goals described below.


### Public Members

- `SpellChecker(const char* filename)`: receives the address of a C-style null-terminated string that holds the name of the file that contains the misspelled words. If the file exists, this constructor loads its contents. If the file is missing, this constructor throws an exception of type `const char*`, with the message `Bad file name!`. Each line in the file has the format `BAD_WORD  GOOD_WORD`; the two fields can be separated by any number of spaces.

- `void operator()(std::string& text)`: this operator searches `text` and replaces any misspelled word with the correct version. It should also count how many times **each** misspelled word has been replaced.

  When implementing this operator, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)
  - [std::string::replace()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/replace)

- `void showStatistics(std::ostream& out) const`: inserts into the parameter how many times each misspelled word has been replaced by the correct word using the current instance. The format of the output is:

  ```txt
  BAD_WORD: CNT replacements<endl>
  ```

  where `BAD_WORD` is to be printed on a field of size 15, aligned to the right.

  **You will have to design a method to remember how many times each bad word has been replaced.**




### `collection` Module


Add a `collection` module to your project. The purpose of this module is to manage a collection media items. This class will take owneship of **ALL** `MediaItem` objects provided by the client and becomes responsible to manage their life. It is assumed, that all pointers received from the client store the address of **dynamically allocated** objects. When a new item is added to the collection, this class informs the client using a *callback function*.

This class provides two overloads of the subscripting operator (`operator[]`) to access a stored item.


***Private Data***

- the name of the collection;
- an STL container to store the media items
- a pointer to a function that returns `void` and receives two parameters of type `const Collection&` and `const MediaItem&` in that order.

  This is the **observer** function (it *observes* an event): when an item has been added to the collection, the class `Collection` will call this function informing the client about the addition.


***Public Members***

- `Collection(const std::string& name)`: sets the name of the collection to the string referred to by the parameter and sets all other attributes to their default value
- this class doesn't support any copy/move operations; delete all of them.
- a destructor
- `const std::string& name() const`: a query that returns the name of the collection.
- `size_t size() const`: a query that returns the number of items in the collection.

- `void setObserver(void (*observer)(const Collection&, const MediaItem&))`: stores the address of the callback function (`observer`) into an attribute. This parameter is a pointer to a function that returns `void` and accepts two parameters: a collection and an item that has just been added to the collection. This function is called when an item is added to the collection.

- `Collection& operator+=(MediaItem* item)`: adds the `item` to the collection, only if the collection doesn't contain an item with the same title. If `item` is already in the collection, this function deletes the parameter.  If the item is added to the collection and an observer has been registered, this operator calls the observer function passing the current object (`*this`) and the new item as arguments.

- `MediaItem* operator[](size_t idx) const`: returns the item at index `idx`.
  - if the index is out of range, this operator throws an exception of type `std::out_of_range` with the message `Bad index [IDX]. Collection has [SIZE] items.`. Use operator `+` to concatenate strings.

  When implementing this operator, consider the following:
  - [std::to_string()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string)
  - [std::out_of_range](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/out_of_range)

- `MediaItem* operator[](const std::string& title) const`: returns the address of the item with the title `title`. If no such item exists, this function returns `nullptr`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This is a `TASK` that you must accomplish using STL Algorithms and no manual loops. The STL algorithms used for this task should not be used for another task. Your lambda expressions should not capture anything from the context by reference.

- `void removeQuotes()`: for all the items stored in this collection, remove the quotation marks from the begining/end of the title and summary.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This is a `TASK` that you must accomplish using STL Algorithms and no manual loops. The STL algorithms used for this task should not be used for another task. Your lambda expressions should not capture anything from the context by reference.

- `void sort(const std::string& field)`: sort in ascending order the collection of items based on the field specified as parameter.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This is a `TASK` that you must accomplish using STL Algorithms and no manual loops. The STL algorithms used for this task should not be used for another task. Your lambda expressions should not capture anything from the context by reference.

  The results of this procedure will be different between various compilers. Check the provided sample output for your compiler.





***FREE Helpers***

- overload the insertion operator to insert the content of a `Collection` object into an **ostream** object. Iterate over all elements in the collection and insert each one into the `ostream` object (do not add newlines).


**:warning:Important: The class `Collection` should have no knowledge of the custom types you have defined: `Book`, `Movie`, `TvShow`, `SpellChecker`, and `Settings`.**
