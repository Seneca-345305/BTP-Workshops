	//   each part of the data by calling the function `computeAvgFactor`. Add the obtained
	//   average-factors to compute total average. Use the resulting total average as the
	//   average value argument for the function computeVarFactor, to compute variance-factors
	//   for each part of the data. Use multi-threading to compute variance-factor for each
	//   part of the data. Add computed variance-factors to obtain total variance.
